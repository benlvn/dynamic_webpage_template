# Dynamic Webpage Template
This application creates a folder with starter code for a webpage. All the user has to do is add their code! The webpage is built from a single HTML file. This file is linked to custom CSS and javascript files. Bootstrap and JQuery are also included

## Usage
Download this code repository and place in your desired location, which we'll call $REPOPATH. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your webpage. From here, run engine.py using python 3
'python3 $REPOPATH/dynamic_webpage_template/engine.py'
Follow the prompt to choose a webpage title, which will also be the name of the directory where your page will live. After the engine completes, you will have a folder in your current directory with your chosen name.

## In the folder
#### index.html
The html webpage. Write your webpage content here. This file also includes outside files and resources.
#### styles.css
Add your custom CSS here
#### script.js
Add your custom javascript here. JQuery is available to use!
